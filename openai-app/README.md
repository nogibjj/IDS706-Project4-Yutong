# Q&A Web App with OpenAI API

This is a web app that can answer questions driven by OpenAI API. The code is adpoted from [OpenAI quickstart repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-python) and [OpenAI quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework.

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the web app.

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-app
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment

   ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```

7. Add your [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file
